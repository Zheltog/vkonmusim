Got 2.5k mp3-files on your local device? Want to import them into VK music automatically (almost)? Check this thing!
##
What can this utility do?
1. Parse mp3 files in directory recursively and generate text file with list of tracks
2. Import tracks in your VK music by generated file
##
NOTES
1. Utility uses Selenium lib so import is performing by opening browser window and automatic clicks in it
2. Nobody's going to hack you. I promise.
